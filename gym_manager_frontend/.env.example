# Create React App (CRA) environment variables
# These are required for CRA builds. Variables MUST be prefixed with REACT_APP_
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Alternative: Vite environment variables (use only if the app is built with Vite)
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# Notes:
# - After editing .env, you MUST restart the dev server/preview to pick up changes.
# - Do NOT commit real secrets to version control.
# - The runtime will log a generic message indicating which prefix was detected
#   ("CRA prefix" or "Vite prefix"), but it will never print secret values.
